      "Palette is one of the closest things to my heart. I began my design journey with the 2019 edition and since then it's been a rollercoaster ride. I still can't believe that I was trying to make a logo on Photoshop back then 😂 It has basically laid the foundation for my entire design journey. If it weren't for Palette, I honestly don't know if I would've ever discovered my passion for design and met such amazing people in the domain of design. I'm very grateful for this event. ❤️",

      "As an aspiring experience designer, Palette'20 was a wonderful opportunity for me to not just put my love for UX into a 48 hour design sprint grind but to also witness some amazing work by fellow aspiring designers out there. It pushed me out of my comfort-zone and in the process, I had so much fun and learnt a lot from the feedback that was given to me at every stage. It was such a memorable lockdown experience and helped me breakout of my productivity rut in the middle of the pandemic!",
